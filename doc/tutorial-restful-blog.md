Tutorial: Restful Blog
========

### Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through building a simple blog site with RESTful endpoints, where you can create new blog posts and read, update, or delete existing ones. This assumes you have a `zz.tcl` as outlined in the [request handler tutorial](setting-up.md) - if not, complete that first.

If you encounter unexpected errors or have difficulty in getting things to work, start by checking your logs - you may find you can find and correct the problem yourself. The command `less /var/log/naviserver/qcode.log` (replacing "qcode.log" with whatever name you chose for your [full config file](qc-config.tcl)) will show you the server's logs - the End key will take you straight to the bottom, where you will find your error. You can also search the logs using `/` followed by the pattern you wish to search for.

## CRUD and RESTful

[CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) refers to four basic functions implemented in many sites - Create, Read, Update, and Delete - each of which roughly corresponds to an equivalent HTTP method (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) and SQL statement (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE). [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) is a software architectural style that has influenced the design of many sites - in particular, you should be familiar with the common convention of [RESTful-style endpoints](https://github.com/qcode-software/qcode/blob/master/wiki/rest.md).

The site you will create in this tutorial will have CRUD functionality, and its endpoints will follow the RESTful convention.

## Database setup

Before writing the site itself, we will create a basic database where its data will be stored. In psql, run the following commands:

```sql
create table entries (
		      entry_id int primary key,
		      entry_title plain_string,
		      entry_content text
		      );

create sequence entry_id_seq;
```

If you have gone through the [database tutorial](tutorial-6-database.md), this should be familiar and require no further explanation.

## Create and Read

Now, create two new files in the `/var/www/alpha.co.uk/tcl` directory - one called `entry.tcl` and one called `url_handlers.tcl`. Add the following code to your `url_handlers.tcl` file:

```tcl
register GET /entries/new {} {
    #| Form for submitting new blog entry
    set form ""
    append form [h label "Blog Title:"]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h input type text name entry_title]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h label "Blog Content:"]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h textarea name entry_content style "width: 400px; height: 120px;"]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h input type submit name submit value Submit]

    return [qc::form method POST action /entries $form]
}
```

Save the file. Restart naviserver using the command `systemctl restart naviserver@qcode` (as with viewing the logs, replace "qcode" with whatever name you chose for your config file). When naviserver has restarted, visit `localhost/entries/new` - you should see a form for submitting a new blog post.

At present, if you click submit, you will see "Not Found", and your browser's address bar should read `localhost/entries` - the button is set up to tell the server to create a new blog entry, but the server has not been told how to deal with such an instruction. To remedy this, start by adding the following code, again to `url_handlers`:

```tcl
register POST /entries {entry_title entry_content} {
    #| Create a new blog entry
    set entry_id [entry_create $entry_title $entry_content]
    ns_returnredirect [qc::url "/entries/$entry_id"]
}
```

If you try the submit button now (after saving the file and restarting naviserver), it will still not work, but you should now see "Internal Server Error" instead of "Not Found". Try checking the logs - they should say something like `App:Error: invalid command name "entry_create"` - this is because we have not created `entry_create` yet. It, and our other procs, will go in the `entry.tcl` file. In `entry.tcl`, add this code:

```tcl
proc entry_create {entry_title entry_content} {
    #| Create a new blog entry
    set entry_id [db_seq entry_id_seq]
    db_dml "insert into entries\
           [sql_insert entry_id entry_title entry_content]"
    return $entry_id
}
```

Save, restart, and try submitting a blog with "test" for the title and content. You should now get "Not Found" again. However, you should see the address is now `localhost/entries/1`, unlike before. Go into psql and run `SELECT * FROM entries;` and you will see that your blog has in fact been successfully submitted.

The reason you are seeing "Not Found" is because you have been redirected to the address that should show you the details of your new blog entry, but the server has not yet been given instructions to deal with that request. To fix that, add this code to your `url_handlers`:

```tcl
register GET /entries/:entry_id {entry_id} {
    #| View an entry
    return [entry_get $entry_id]
}
```

You should now be getting "Internal Server Error" once again. Check the logs if you like, or just look at the code we just added - we are trying use an `entry_get` proc that we haven't written yet. Add the following to `entry.tcl`:

```tcl
proc entry_get {entry_id} {
    #| Return html summary for this entry 
    db_1row {
	select
	entry_title,
	entry_content
	from
	entries
	where entry_id=:entry_id
    }
    set html ""
    append html [h h1 $entry_title]
    append html [h div $entry_content]
    return $html
}
```

After saving and restarting, try submitting a blog post. You should, at last, be able to see the post you have submitted (and you should be able to see your previous posts if you change your address to have their entry_id instead). You have successfully added basic create and read functionality to your site. 

## register, h, and form

Before moving on, let's review some of the procs we have been using in our code.

We have made use of the `register` proc throughout the `url_handlers.tcl` file. This is used to register a path, so that the server has instructions in place for how to deal with, for example, a request such as `GET entries/1`. Note the used of colon variables, for example in your handler for viewing an entry:

```tcl
register GET /entries/:entry_id {entry_id} {
    #| View an entry
    return [entry_get $entry_id]
}
```

By putting a colon at the start of `:entry_id`, we instruct the handler to treat it as a variable name and pass its value to `entry_id` to be used in the function body. For more detail on the register proc, [see its documentation](registration.md).

When constructing our form (and later in the `entry_get` proc), we used the `h` proc to generate html elements for us. The first argument you pass it is the type of html element you want. After specifying the type, any additional elements will be interpreted as alternating key value pairs. If the final argument is unpaired, it is placed in the body of the element. Consider this example:

```tcl
h a href "http://localhost/entries/new" "Submit another blog"
```

This will return a string containing the HTML for an `<a>` element that reads "Submit another blog" and links back to the new entry form. It is preferable to use the `h` proc instead of writing strings of raw HTML yourself, and essential for anything that involves variable substitution - aside from making construction of HTML easier, it also takes care of sanitising your input data and preventing critical security vulnerabilities such as [injection attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_injection#Examples). Additional examples can be found in [its documentation](procs/h.md).

We also used the `form` proc to construct the form you passed to the user. It will return a form element, using the arguments you pass it as key-value pairs and the final unpaired argument you pass it (if applicable) placed in the body of the element. See our example:

```tcl
return [qc::form method POST action /entries $form]
```

Here, it returns a `<form>` element with `method="POST"` and `action="/entries"`, and then places the html we have stored in the `form` string variable inside the body of the form. Use this proc when you are constructing forms - aside from not having to write out the full HTML, it also takes care of attaching a hidden authenticity token - if you see an error that refers to there being no authenticity token, you should check to see if you have skipped over using this proc (or a similar one), which would have taken care of it for you. See its [full documentation](procs/form.md).

## Index and navigation

Before we proceed to implementing update and delete functionality, let's make our site a little easier to get around by adding an index page and some links. Add the following to your `url_handlers` file:

```tcl
register GET /entries {} {
    #| List all entries
    return [entries_index]
}
```

As you can probably guess, trying to access `/entries` will return a server error until we have created the `entries_index` proc. Add the following to `entry.tcl`:

```tcl
proc entries_index {} {
    #| Return html report listing links to view each entry
    set html ""
    append html [h h1 "All Entries"]
    append html [h br]
    db_foreach {
	select
	entry_id,
	entry_title 
	from entries
	order by entry_id asc
    } {
	append html [h a href "http://localhost/entries/$entry_id" $entry_title]
	append html [h br]
    }
    append html [h br]
    append html [h a href "http://localhost/entries/new" "Submit another blog"]
    
    return $html
}
```

After saving and restarting, you should now be able to reach an index page at `/entries`, with links to each of your blog posts and also to the new entry form - note how we used the `h` proc to construct the links as in the example in the previous section. Let's also add a link to the index and to the form when viewing a blog post, and a link back to the index on the form page. Insert the following into your `entry_get` proc after appending the title and content:

```tcl
    append html [h br]
    append html [h a href "http://localhost/entries/new" "Submit another blog"]
    append html [h br]
    append html [h a href "http://localhost/entries" "Return to index"]
```

And add the following to your `entries/new` path registration:

```tcl
    append form [h br]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h a href "http://localhost/entries" "Return to index"]
```

You should now be able to navigate easily around your site.

## Update 

In addition to reading our blog posts and adding new ones, we may also wish to edit or remove them. We will begin with editing. Insert the following code into your `entry_get` proc, just below where you append your entry_content, to add a link to an editing page:

```tcl
    append html [h br]
    append html [h a href "http://localhost/entries/$entry_id/edit" "Edit this blog"]
```

Now, we must create the page we have linked to. Add the following to `url_handlers`:

```tcl
register GET /entries/:entry_id/edit {entry_id} {
    #| Form for editing a specific blog entry
    db_1row {
        select
	entry_title,
	entry_content
	from
	entries
	where entry_id=:entry_id
    }
    set form ""
    append form [h label "Blog Title:"]
    append form [h input type text name entry_title value $entry_title]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h label "Blog Content:"]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h textarea name entry_content style "width: 400px; height: 120px;" $entry_content]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h input type hidden name _method value PUT]
    append form [h input type submit name submit value Update]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h br]
    append form [h a href "http://localhost/entries" "Return to index"]
    
    return [qc::form method POST action "/entries/$entry_id" $form]
}
```
The link should now lead to a new page containing a form prepopulated with the current title and content of your blog entry. Currently, clicking the "Update" button should return "Not Found". Add this to `url_handlers`:

```tcl
register PUT /entries/:entry_id {entry_id entry_title entry_content} {
    #| Update an entry
    entry_update $entry_id $entry_title $entry_content
    ns_returnredirect [qc::url "/entries/$entry_id"]
}
```

"Not Found" should now be replaced by "Internal Server Error" due to `entry_update` not existing yet. Add it to `entry.tcl`:

```tcl
proc entry_update {entry_id entry_title entry_content} {
    #| Update an entry
    db_dml "update entries \
            set [sql_set entry_title entry_content] \
            where entry_id=:entry_id"
    return $entry_id
}
```

Your update function should now be working properly - try editing a blog post to confirm this.

## Delete

Finally, we must add a way to delete our blog posts. Insert the following into your `entry_get` proc, directly under your edit link:

```tcl
    append html [h br]
    append html [form method DELETE action /entries/$entry_id \
		     [h input type submit name submit value "Delete this blog"]]
```

You should now have a "Delete this blog" button below your "Update this blog" link. Clicking it should lead to a "Not Found" error. Add the following to `url_handlers`:

```tcl
register DELETE /entries/:entry_id {entry_id} {
    #| Delete an entry
    entry_delete $entry_id
    ns_returnredirect [qc::url "/entries"]
}
```

To correct our final server error, add the `entry_delete` proc to `entry.tcl`:

```tcl
proc entry_delete {entry_id} {
    #| Delete an entry
    db_dml "delete from entries where entry_id=:entry_id"
}
```

Save, restart, and try deleting a blog entry. You should be sent back to the index page, and the blog you have deleted should no longer be visible there. Your site now has full CRUD functionality and a set of RESTful endpoints. Well done.

## _method 

One useful feature we have used that you should take careful note of is the use of `_method` to specify the HTTP method when we are making a PUT or DELETE request. In our naviserver instance, the PUT and DELETE methods are emulated using POST requests with special hidden inputs that pass along a variable instructing the server to interpret the request as PUT or DELETE. For example, in our edit form, you may have noticed this line of code:

```tcl
append form [h input type hidden name _method value PUT]
```

And you may also have noticed that despite the update functionality being registered as a PUT request in our `url_handlers` file, our edit form appears to make a POST request:

```tcl
return [qc::form method POST action "/entries/$entry_id" $form]
```

The handler knows to check for an input named `_method` when it receives the POST request, and after finding that `_method` exists and has a value of PUT, treats the POST request as a PUT request.

Similarly, when we use the `form` proc to create our "Delete" button, we use a hidden `_method` input - in this case however, we let the `form` proc handle this for us by simply including "method DELETE" in the `form` proc's arguments:

```tcl
    append html [form method DELETE action /entries/$entry_id \
		     [h input type submit name submit value "Delete this blog"]]
```

If you refer back to the `form` proc's [documentation](procs/form.md), you will see in the second example how the proc inserts the hidden input for us (in addition to the authenticity token).
